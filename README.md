# 🛋️ LeetCode Therapy

> *"Forgive me, FAANG, for I have sinned. I seek redemption through this daily grind."*


## 📜 The Commandments
1.  Thou shalt not look at the solution before 20 minutes of struggling.
2.  Thou shalt handle edge cases (even the empty arrays).
3.  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's O(1) space complexity.
4.  If it works but it's ugly, it's still a solution.
