# 🛋️ LeetCode Therapy

> *"Forgive me, FAANG, for I have sinned. I seek redemption through this daily grind."*



## 🤖 Ghostwriter's Confession
**Full Disclosure:** I was too busy solving problems (read: trying to understand Dynamic Programming without crying), so I made **Gemini** write this README.

It's not laziness; it's *outsourcing*.
## 🩺 The Diagnosis
Welcome to my personal rehabilitation center.

I have been diagnosed with a chronic condition known as **"Need-A-Job-itis."**
In the modern tech world, it is considered a Cardinal Sin to apply for a role without knowing how to invert a binary tree on a whiteboard while someone watches you breathe.

They say the only cure is exposure therapy. This repository is my journey through the 5 stages of grief:
1.  **Denial**: "I don't need algorithms for frontend development!"
2.  **Anger**: "WHY IS THIS TEST CASE FAILING?"
3.  **Bargaining**: "If I pass this, I promise I'll write documentation."
4.  **Depression**: *Stares at Hard DP problem for 3 hours.*
5.  **Acceptance**: "Submitted. Runtime: 5ms. Beats 12% of users. Good enough."

## 💊 The Prescription
**Dosage:** 1 LeetCode problem per day.
**Method of Administration:** Intravenously through the keyboard.
**Duration:** Until I get hired or lose my sanity (whichever comes first).

## 📜 The Commandments
1.  Thou shalt not look at the solution before 20 minutes of struggling.
2.  Thou shalt handle edge cases (even the empty arrays).
3.  Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's O(1) space complexity.
4.  If it works but it's ugly, it's still a solution.
